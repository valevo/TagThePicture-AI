# AI for and from TagThePicture 

Code repository for experimenting with training automatic tagging models on the data produced by the Tag The Picture crowd-sourcing platform and in an attempt to more extensively describe the NMVW's photography collection.

See https://gentle-asiago-896.notion.site/Tag-the-Picture-Using-AI-1355cda00d098018b483dae9533b96ef for more information on the project.

For now, some first insights into the data (not shared here because private) can be found in the [first-insights Jupyter notebook](./data/first-insights.ipynb).
